# WP React and Beyond Product Catalog

This guide is meant to re-create the [React workshop](https://www.facebook.com/events/1790427334434597/) we did but on your local development setup which makes the experience much better. The purpose of this app is to display the list of products from your WordPress WooCommerce. We fetch data via GraphQL (configured with plugins to allow such functionality) and with React to create a blazing fast product catalog with search functionality and more.

This React app was bootsrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
